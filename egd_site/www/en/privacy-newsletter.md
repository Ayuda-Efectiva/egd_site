# Newsletter privacy policy

## Personal data protection

The personal data provided will be included in a file under the responsibility of FUNDACIÓN AYUDA EFECTIVA (hereafter the “FOUNDATION”), of Calle Vaguada del Arcipreste, 2 bis, 28220 Majadahonda, Madrid, for the purpose of sending you a newsletter about information, news or events of the FOUNDATION.

The legal basis for this processing is your consent given at the time of sending your request to subscribe to the newsletter. The data will be processed indefinitely until you revoke your consent or request the deletion of your data. The personal data will not be transferred to third parties unless the FOUNDATION is legally obliged to do so.

We inform you that the newsletter will be sent through the tool SMTP2GO, managed by the company Sand Dune Mail Ltd. whose servers are located in New Zealand, a company that complies with the European General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR ([https://www.smtp2go.com/privacy/](https://www.smtp2go.com/privacy/)).

The tool used to send the newsletter by email will include links and tiny, transparent images that will be associated with your email address. In this way, when you download one of these images or access the links contained in the email, the FOUNDATION can know for statistical purposes whether the email has been opened or whether a link has been accessed from that email. You may prevent these uses by configuring your manager or e-mail program to prevent automated downloading of images, as well as by not accessing the links included in the e-mails you receive.

In each communication, you will be able to opt-out of receiving this type of information through the indicated means of contact to process your cancellation.

At any time you may revoke your consent and exercise your rights of access, rectification, deletion, opposition, limitation and portability of your data by sending an e-mail or posting a request to the address indicated, providing a copy of your ID card or equivalent document, identifying yourself as a subscriber to the newsletter and specifying your request. If you consider that your right to data protection has been violated, you may file a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency (www.aepd.es).
